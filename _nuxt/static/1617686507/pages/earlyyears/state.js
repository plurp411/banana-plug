Okay no, I'm just kidding - it's me Collin. I'm the guy that made that Banana Plug app where people could buy drugs at UC Santa Cruz.

I wasn’t just the president of the Engineering Club at our school, but I was also in charge of our high school’s robotics team. 😑 I know right - big time nerd. My friends and I even spent our lunches in the school library, where the most exciting event of the day was often when someone sneezed a little too loud. It was lame."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fwww.splunk.com\u002Fcontent\u002Fdam\u002Fsplunk-blogs\u002Fimages\u002F2013\u002F07\u002F20130624_144326.jpg",caption:"My Robotics Team"},{text:"I say all this, because the first time I got high was like a million times better than all of that crap. I mean I was honestly just kind of bored in school - it all seemed pointless. Like you’re telling me that I go through all these years of schooling just to get some crappy job that I’m probably not gonna be happy at anyways, and then I’m gonna be stuck living in some suburban home sending my own kids to school… I don’t know about you, but to me that just sounded like a boring life. I mean all these famous people we hear about are all doing crazy crap that seems risky but ends up being fucking awesome - like Ghandi or Steve Jobs."},{text:"Okay, so maybe that’s a bit of an exaggeration, but at the time that’s about where my mind was at.

Unfortunately for most of the people talking about drugs in the media, and sadly for us, I don’t think most of them have ever rolled a fat blunt or done lines of meth off their table (at least I don’t think so 😂). I mean we’ve all been told not to use drugs, but when you’re introduced to them for the first time, everyone’s first response is to pass it on over and let them take a turn."},{text:"For nerds in high school, you might never get to use drugs, which almost happened for me. Let me explain. If you don’t already know, being a nerd means that more popular and better looking people than you have fun, and you try to imagine yourself having fun in their shoes. So as you can see, it’s not really all that great, in fact it’s actually kinda sad. But then, as if an angel had been sent from above, half way through our high school lives, we caught a break. For some strange reason the popular kids at our school invited a couple of us in our nerd gang to go to one of their parties - we all practically shit ourselves."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fi.gifer.com\u002FIWpP.gif",caption:"Revenge of the Nerds (1984)"},{text:"The one thing that we never thought would happen just happened. I mean we’re talking drugs, alcohol, girls, it was gonna be sweet! And because all of us were so eager to go, we somehow managed to convince the host, against his best judgement, to let all of the members of our nerd crew come to the party. What followed was the most awkward evening for all involved."},{text:"Things started off fine at first. I mean we mostly just stood around and stared at girls for a few hours, which was all we could really ask for. But then some of us started drinking, and then some of us started smoking weed, and soon enough half of us were wasted and throwing up all over the place. Alright, so maybe having a group of ten virgins roll up to your house to party for the first time wasn’t of great an idea as it sounds."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia1.giphy.com\u002Fmedia\u002FrumR5iFBxFjdC\u002F200.gif",caption:"Woooo! 💃🎉"}]}]},{index:4,id:"red-velvet",title:"Red Velvet (OutKast)",date:b,contents:[{subtitle:"Cigarette Smoke",textImages:[{text:"I woke up the next morning and felt like a dog probably does after it gets run over by a car. The last thing I remembered was stealing ice cream from the host’s ziptied fridge.

Instead I decided that I wanted to be drunk all day e'ry day."},{image:"https:\u002F\u002Fmedia3.giphy.com\u002Fmedia\u002Fl3fZNsl7M1FJH3FHW\u002Fgiphy-downsized.gif",caption:"The Hangover (2009)"},{text:"And it was cool for a while. You know, being at school totally plastered or high out of my mind. It’s fun not to care sometimes. And when you don’t care, you also wanna be around people who don’t care. That’s where my “bad influence” friends come into play."},{text:"We all have those people that we know we shouldn’t hang out with or talk to, but we do anyways. For me, it was these two sexy russian twins who loved to get high even more than I did. The way we met probably wasn’t a great sign to begin with. My friends and I were at the park just shooting shit when we saw these girls smoking some cigs. And because I was wasted, I just went up to them and talked shit and messed with them. After talking for a little and realizing they were cute, I got their contact info and peaced out. Meanwhile my friends are all freaking out because I was talking to “cigarette smokers” 😂 - VERY taboo."}]}]},{index:5,id:"final",title:"Exit Music (Radiohead)",date:"4\u002F4\u002F21",contents:a}]},products:{all:[{title:"App Icon T-Shirt This Is An Item",price:c,imageSrc:d,id:"somewhere",size:e},{title:"App Icon T-Shirt",price:c,imageSrc:d,id:"something",size:e}]}},serverRendered:true,routePath:"\u002Fpages\u002Fearlyyears",config:{}}}(null,"10\u002F7\u002F20",19.99,"https:\u002F\u002Flp2.hm.com\u002Fhmgoepprod?set=quality%5B79%5D%2Csource%5B%2Ff5%2Fc4%2Ff5c4939114fcc731acfada4ebb68f1da42cad909.jpg%5D%2Corigin%5Bdam%5D%2Ccategory%5Bmen_tshirtstanks_shortsleeve%5D%2Ctype%5BDESCRIPTIVESTILLLIFE%5D%2Cres%5Bm%5D%2Chmver%5B1%5D&call=url[file:\u002Fproduct\u002Fmain]","large"));
